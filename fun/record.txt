Both python.py and cpp.cpp are used to print 1e7 numbers.
While python need 30 s and cpp need 20 s.
Cpp is much faster than python. 
But sometimes I noticed that python will automatically create a pychae file that used to facilate the python calculation. In this case, no pychae files are discovered. Maybe after generate this files, the python would be faster.
