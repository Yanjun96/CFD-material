Introduction to MPI programming:
MPI: message passing interface.
shared memory multiprocessor: uniform memory access and nonuniform memory access.
cache: main memory is shared, caches are local to individual processors.
cache coherence oroblem: need synchronization, generic 3 steps, related to lock.

synchronous communication: sender/receiver wait until data has been sent/received.

dardel: node is a shared system, one node has 2 cpus, these cpus have their own cache.

SPMD: single program multiple data.
single program is exectued by all tasks simultaneously.

MPMD: multiple program multiple data.

we focus on SPMD: need to decompose a problem
Functional decomposition: each task then performs a portion of the overall work.

data distribution: job needs to be allocated evenly.

Message passing: low level programming, difficult to use.
